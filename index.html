<p>The ScalaBlog is a fully functioning Blog.
It was originally written as a training tool for Scala and the TypeSafe 
technology stack; <a href="http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform">http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform</a></p>

<p>It is subsequently written with verbose comments and with readability always in 
focus. Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse code that we could 
have. Which is a real strength of Scala.</p>

<p>The ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to  better 
understand "BIG DATA". Subsequently it uses Hadoop and some related technologies
that simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.
Nonetheless - they are used here!</p>

<p>The ScalaBlog application is free to use.</p>

<p>The blog utilises the following technology;</p>

<hr>

<p>** Scala 2.11.7 **</p>

<hr>

<p>Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with 
you. You can play with it by typing one-line expressions and observing the 
results. But you can also rely on it for large mission critical systems, as many 
companies, including Twitter, LinkedIn, or Intel do.</p>

<p>To some, Scala feels like a scripting language. Its syntax is concise and low 
ceremony; </p>

<ul>
<li>Its types get out of the way because the compiler can infer them. </li>
<li>There’s a REPL and IDE worksheets for quick feedback. Developers like it so 
much that Scala won the ScriptBowl contest at the 2012 JavaOne conference.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission 
critical server systems.  The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its 
precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than 
after deployment.</p>

<p>At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration 
of object-oriented and functional language concepts.</p>

<hr>

<p>** Scala Test 2.2.5 - Testing Framework  **</p>

<hr>

<p>With ScalaTest, you can test either Scala or Java code. By offering deep 
integration with tools such as JUnit, TestNG, Ant, Maven, sbt, ScalaCheck, 
JMock, EasyMock, Mockito, ScalaMock, Selenium, Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ, 
ScalaTest makes it easy to take your testing to a higher,  more productive level
in new or existing Scala or Java projects.</p>

<p>Like the Scala language on which it is built, ScalaTest is designed to grow with
the demands of its users:  You can easily extend and compose ScalaTest's core 
components to address just about any special requirements you may have. As a 
result, ScalaTest can scale to projects of all sizes, from an individual 
exploring a new idea to large teams collaborating on mission-critical software.</p>

<p>One way ScalaTest scales down is that despite its rich feature set, ScalaTest is
easy to get into. Building on what you already know from experience with other 
test frameworks, you can become productive with ScalaTest very quickly.</p>

<p>To maximize your productivity, ScalaTest uses its own extension points to 
support several styles of testing out of the box. You can select whatever style 
best fits your team's experience and culture. For instance, the above example 
uses FlatSpec, a good choice for teams wishing to move from XUnit to BDD. When 
you run it, you get an informal specification of the software being tested:</p>

<hr>

<p>** Akka 2.3.14 **</p>

<hr>

<p>What is Akka?
Scalable real-time transaction processing</p>

<p>We believe that writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable 
applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong 
tools and the wrong level of abstraction. Akka is here to change that. Using the
Actor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to 
build scalable, resilient and responsive applications—see the Reactive Manifesto 
(<a href="http://reactivemanifesto.org/">http://reactivemanifesto.org/</a>) for more details. </p>

<p>For fault-tolerance we adopt the "let it crash" model which the telecom industry
has used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems 
that never stop. Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent 
distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.</p>

<p>Akka is Open Source and available under the Apache 2 License.
Download from <a href="http://akka.io/downloads">http://akka.io/downloads</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that all code samples compile, so if you want direct access to the 
sources, have a look over at the Akka Docs subproject on github: for Java and 
Scala.</p>

<hr>

<p>** Play 2.4.3 - MVC Framework **</p>

<hr>

<p>Play is a high-productivity Java and Scala web application framework that 
integrates the components and APIs you need for modern web application 
development.</p>

<p>Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and 
features predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for
highly-scalable applications thanks to its reactive model, based on Iteratee IO.</p>

<hr>

<p>** spray 2.3.3 **</p>

<hr>

<p>spray is a suite of lightweight Scala libraries providing client- and 
server-side REST/HTTP support on top Akka.</p>

<p>We believe that, having chosen Scala (and possibly Akka) as primary tools for 
building software, you’ll want to rely on their power not only in your 
application layer but throughout the full (JVM-level) network stack. Spray 
provides just that: a set of integrated components for all your REST/HTTP needs 
that let you work with idiomatic Scala (and Akka) APIs at the stack level of 
your choice, all implemented without any wrapping layers around “legacy” Java 
libraries.</p>

<hr>

<p>** Cassandra Database 2.1.8 **</p>

<hr>

<p>Apache Cassandra, a top level Apache project born at Facebook and built on 
Amazon’s Dynamo and Google’s BigTable, is a distributed database for managing 
large amounts of structured data across many commodity servers, while  providing
highly available service and no single point of failure.  Cassandra offers 
capabilities that relational databases and other NoSQL databases simply cannot 
match such as: continuous availability, linear scale performance, operational 
simplicity and easy data distribution across multiple data centers and cloud 
availability zones.</p>

<hr>

<p>** Hadoop / Hadoop File System 2.7.1 **</p>

<hr>

<p>Apache Hadoop is a framework for running applications on large cluster built of 
commodity hardware. The Hadoop framework transparently provides applications 
both reliability and data motion. Hadoop implements a computational paradigm 
named Map/Reduce, where the application is divided into many small fragments of 
work, each of which may be executed or re-executed on any node in the cluster. 
In addition, it provides a distributed file system (HDFS) that stores data on 
the compute nodes, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster. 
Both MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System are designed so that node 
failures are automatically handled by the framework.</p>

<hr>

<p>** jQuery 2.1.4 **</p>

<hr>

<p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things 
like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and 
Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of 
browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has 
changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap 3.3.4 *
*******************
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing 
responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Bootstrap makes front-end web 
development faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices 
of all shapes, and projects of all sizes.</li>

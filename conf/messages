#
# The ScalaBlog is a fully functioning Blog.
# It was originally written as a training tool for Scala and the TypeSafe
# technology stack; http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform
# 
# It is subsequently written with verbose comments and with readability
# always in focus. Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse
# code that we could have. Which is a real strength of Scala.
# 
# The ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to 
# better understand "BIG DATA". Subsequently it uses Hadoop and some related
# technologies that simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.
# Nonetheless - they are used here!
#
# The ScalaBlog application is free to use.
#
# 
# The blog utilises the following technology;
# 
# Scala 2.11.7
# Scala Test 2.2.5 - Testing Framework
# Play 2.4.3 - MVC Framework
# Akka 2.3.14 - Messaging
# spray 2.3.3 - http
# Cassandra Database 2.1.8
# Hadoop / Hadoop File System 2.7.1
# jQuery 2.1.4 - JavaScript Library
# Bootstrap 3.3.4 - JavaScript Library
#
# This is the default MESSAGES file.
# It is used for providing internationalisation of your application.
#
# THIS file is used when a key is not found in a message file for a specific language.
#     Eg. If there is a missing key in messages.es (Spanish message file)
# Or if indeed there is a missing locale's message file, entirely.
#     Eg. There is no messages file for Japanese users (messages.jp)

Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse code that we could \r\nhave. Which is a real strength of Scala.\r\n \r\nThe ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to  better \r\nunderstand \"BIG DATA\". Subsequently it uses Hadoop and some related technologies\r\nthat simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.\r\nNonetheless - they are used here!\r\n\r\nThe ScalaBlog application is free to use.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe blog utilises the following technology;\r\n\r\n****************** \r\n** Scala 2.11.7 **\r\n******************\r\n \r\nScala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with \r\nyou. You can play with it by typing one-line expressions and observing the \r\nresults. But you can also rely on it for large mission critical systems, as many \r\ncompanies, including Twitter, LinkedIn, or Intel do.\r\n\r\nTo some, Scala feels like a scripting language. Its syntax is concise and low \r\nceremony; \r\n* Its types get out of the way because the compiler can infer them. \r\n* There’s a REPL and IDE worksheets for quick feedback. Developers like it so \r\n    much that Scala won the ScriptBowl contest at the 2012 JavaOne conference.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission \r\ncritical server systems.  The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its \r\nprecise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than \r\nafter deployment.\r\n\r\nAt the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration \r\nof object-oriented and functional language concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************     \r\n** Scala Test 2.2.5 - Testing Framework  **\r\n*******************************************\r\n\r\nWith ScalaTest, you can test either Scala or Java code. By offering deep \r\nintegration with tools such as JUnit, TestNG, Ant, Maven, sbt, ScalaCheck, \r\nJMock, EasyMock, Mockito, ScalaMock, Selenium, Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ, \r\nScalaTest makes it easy to take your testing to a higher,  more productive level\r\nin new or existing Scala or Java projects.\r\n\r\nLike the Scala language on which it is built, ScalaTest is designed to grow with\r\nthe demands of its users:  You can easily extend and compose ScalaTest's core \r\ncomponents to address just about any special requirements you may have. As a \r\nresult, ScalaTest can scale to projects of all sizes, from an individual \r\nexploring a new idea to large teams collaborating on mission-critical software.\r\n\r\nOne way ScalaTest scales down is that despite its rich feature set, ScalaTest is\r\neasy to get into. Building on what you already know from experience with other \r\ntest frameworks, you can become productive with ScalaTest very quickly.\r\n\r\nTo maximize your productivity, ScalaTest uses its own extension points to \r\nsupport several styles of testing out of the box. You can select whatever style \r\nbest fits your team's experience and culture. For instance, the above example \r\nuses FlatSpec, a good choice for teams wishing to move from XUnit to BDD. When \r\nyou run it, you get an informal specification of the software being tested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************\r\n** Akka 2.3.14 **\r\n*****************\r\n \r\nWhat is Akka?\r\nScalable real-time transaction processing\r\n\r\nWe believe that writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable \r\napplications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong \r\ntools and the wrong level of abstraction. Akka is here to change that. Using the\r\nActor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to \r\nbuild scalable, resilient and responsive applications—see the Reactive Manifesto \r\n(http://reactivemanifesto.org/) for more details. \r\n\r\nFor fault-tolerance we adopt the \"let it crash\" model which the telecom industry\r\nhas used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems \r\nthat never stop. Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent \r\ndistribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.\r\n\r\nAkka is Open Source and available under the Apache 2 License.\r\nDownload from http://akka.io/downloads.\r\n\r\nPlease note that all code samples compile, so if you want direct access to the \r\nsources, have a look over at the Akka Docs subproject on github: for Java and \r\nScala.\r\n\r\n \r\n*********************************\r\n** Play 2.4.3 - MVC Framework **\r\n*********************************\r\n \r\nPlay is a high-productivity Java and Scala web application framework that \r\nintegrates the components and APIs you need for modern web application \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nPlay is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and \r\nfeatures predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for\r\nhighly-scalable applications thanks to its reactive model, based on Iteratee IO.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************\r\n** spray 2.3.3 **\r\n*****************\r\n\r\nspray is a suite of lightweight Scala libraries providing client- and \r\nserver-side REST/HTTP support on top Akka.\r\n\r\nWe believe that, having chosen Scala (and possibly Akka) as primary tools for \r\nbuilding software, you’ll want to rely on their power not only in your \r\napplication layer but throughout the full (JVM-level) network stack. Spray \r\nprovides just that: a set of integrated components for all your REST/HTTP needs \r\nthat let you work with idiomatic Scala (and Akka) APIs at the stack level of \r\nyour choice, all implemented without any wrapping layers around “legacy” Java \r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n******************************\r\n** Cassandra Database 2.1.8 **\r\n******************************\r\n\r\nApache Cassandra, a top level Apache project born at Facebook and built on \r\nAmazon’s Dynamo and Google’s BigTable, is a distributed database for managing \r\nlarge amounts of structured data across many commodity servers, while  providing\r\nhighly available service and no single point of failure.  Cassandra offers \r\ncapabilities that relational databases and other NoSQL databases simply cannot \r\nmatch such as: continuous availability, linear scale performance, operational \r\nsimplicity and easy data distribution across multiple data centers and cloud \r\navailability zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n***************************************\r\n** Hadoop / Hadoop File System 2.7.1 **\r\n***************************************\r\n\r\nApache Hadoop is a framework for running applications on large cluster built of \r\ncommodity hardware. The Hadoop framework transparently provides applications \r\nboth reliability and data motion. Hadoop implements a computational paradigm \r\nnamed Map/Reduce, where the application is divided into many small fragments of \r\nwork, each of which may be executed or re-executed on any node in the cluster. \r\nIn addition, it provides a distributed file system (HDFS) that stores data on \r\nthe compute nodes, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster. \r\nBoth MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System are designed so that node \r\nfailures are automatically handled by the framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n******************\r\n** jQuery 2.1.4 **\r\n******************\r\n\r\njQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things \r\nlike HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and \r\nAjax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of \r\nbrowsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has \r\nchanged the way that millions of people write JavaScript.\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************\r\n* Bootstrap 3.3.4 *\r\n*******************\r\nBootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing \r\nresponsive, mobile first projects on the web. Bootstrap makes front-end web \r\ndevelopment faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices \r\nof all shapes, and projects of all sizes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

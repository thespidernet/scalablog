 * The ScalaBlog is a fully functioning Blog.
 * It was originally written as a training tool for Scala and the TypeSafe
 * technology stack; http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform
 * 
 * It is subsequently written with verbose comments and with readability
 * always in focus. Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse
 * code that we could have. Which is a real strength of Scala.
 * 
 * The ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to 
 * better understand "BIG DATA". Subsequently it uses Hadoop and some related
 * technologies that simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.
 * Nonetheless - they are used here!
 *
 * The ScalaBlog application is free to use.
 *
 * 
 * The blog utilises the following technology;
 * 
 * Scala 2.11.7
 * Scala Test 3.0.0 - Testing Framework
 * Play 2.4.3 - MVC Framework
 * Akka 2.4.0 - Messaging
 * spray 2.3.3 - http
 * Cassandra Database 2.1.8
 * Hadoop / Hadoop File System 2.7.1
 * jQuery 2.1.4 - JavaScript Library
 * Bootstrap 3.3.4 - JavaScript Library

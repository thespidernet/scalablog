 * The ScalaBlog is a fully functioning Blog.
 * It was originally written as a training tool for Scala and the TypeSafe
 * technology stack; http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform
 * 
 * It is subsequently written with verbose comments and with readability
 * always in focus. Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse
 * code that we could have. Which is a real strength of Scala.
 * 
 * The ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to 
 * better understand "BIG DATA". Subsequently it uses Hadoop and some related
 * technologies that simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.
 * Nonetheless - they are used here!
 *
 * The ScalaBlog application is free to use.
 *
 * 
 * The blog utilises the following technology;
 * 
 * Scala 2.11.7
 * Scala Test 2.2.5 - Testing Framework
 * Play 2.4.3 - MVC Framework
 * Akka 2.3.14 - Messaging
 * spray 2.3.3 - http
 * Cassandra Database 2.1.8
 * Hadoop / Hadoop File System 2.7.1
 * jQuery 2.1.4 - JavaScript Library
 * Bootstrap 3.3.4 - JavaScript Library

      * The following DIV element is used just for styling. It is not necessary. 
      *	
      * The noteworthy part of the DIV is the creation of the form and the form 
      * input elements by use of the Play framework's "helpers"
      * 
      * @form() is passed the controller method that will act as the ACTION
      * via "routes.Application.appconfigsubmit()"
      *
      * The form is passed in at the forst line of THIS template and is named 
      * AppConfig 
      *	
      * We can then pass in the form items by constructing form contents via 
      * the Play helpers
      * (Eg. @inputText(AppConfig("blogtitle")))
      * 
      * The string provided is the field name and ID ("blogtitle").
      * it is also used to map a field label, via the /conf/messages file.

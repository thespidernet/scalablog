 * The ScalaBlog is a fully functioning Blog.
 * It was originally written as a training tool for Scala and the TypeSafe
 * technology stack.
 * 
 * It is subsequently written with verbose comments and with readability
 * always in the focus. Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse
 * code that we could have.
 * 
 * The ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to 
 * better understand "BIG DATA". Subsequently is uses Hadoop and some related
 * technologies that simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.
 * Nonetheless - they are used here!
 *
 * The ScalaBlog application is free to use.
 *
 * 
 * The blog utilises the following technology;
 * 
 * Scala 2.11.3
 * Play 2.3.8 - MVC Framework
 * Akka 
 * Spray
 * Cassandra Database
 * Hadoop File System
 * Hadoop
 * Bootstrap / jQuery
 *

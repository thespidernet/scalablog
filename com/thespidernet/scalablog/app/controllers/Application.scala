  * The ScalaBlog is a fully functioning Blog.
  * It was originally written as a training tool for Scala and the TypeSafe
  * technology stack; http://typesafe.com/products/typesafe-reactive-platform
  *
  * It is subsequently written with verbose comments and with readability
  * always in focus. Thus we have not always used the most concise / terse
  * code that we could have. Which is a real strength of Scala.
  *
  * The ScalaBlog also became the training ground for our efforts to
  * better understand "BIG DATA". Subsequently it uses Hadoop and some related
  * technologies that simply just aren't a requirement for a blog application.
  * Nonetheless - they are used here!
  *
  * The ScalaBlog application is free to use.
  *
  *
  * The blog utilises the following technology;
  *
  * Scala 2.11.3
  * Play 2.3.8 - MVC Framework
  * Akka
  * Spray
  * Cassandra Database
  * Hadoop File System
  * Hadoop
